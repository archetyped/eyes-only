The ultimate tool for publishing your private thoughts in public

== Description ==
Eyes Only is the ultimate tool for seamless site privacy.  Write your private thoughts with full control over what others can or cannot see.
Using **redaction** (masking/hiding), any private details in a post can be masked or replaced while still allowing visitors to read the rest of the post's content.

### Features
* Manually redact (mask) text in posts by using handy editor buttons (visual and HTML editor)
* Automatically replace text in any post with another word/phrase of your choosing using **Automatic Redactions**

#### Manual Redaction
Select text to redact in the post editor and click the **Redact** button (visual and HTML editor)

#### Automatic Redaction
* Define automatic redactions at **Settings > Eyes Only** that will hide user-defined text in any post
* Click the **Help** tab on the settings page for full instructions on how to add/edit automatic redactions
